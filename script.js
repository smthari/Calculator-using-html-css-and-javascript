// targeted elements by id and assign into variables ( weâ€™ll use these variables later in tutorial to print calculation text and result text )

/* function to insert number onclick */

// targeting clear button by id and assign a blank value to the calculation and 0 to result on click event listener

/* on click event listener targeting equal button by id then 
- assign the calculation to the exp variable (we'll use this variable to evaluates calculation using eval method)
- assign exp variable using the eval method and assign to the result to result screen 
- assign the output of the result to the calculation to print result to calculation screen too  */

// target back key button by id and assign value of calculation to exp variable then assign calculation by substring exp variable from 0 to (length of exp -1 )
